### HOW TO RUN IT

I have 2 different folders, one for the backend and one for the frontend.\

I have created two docker containers,one for each directory.\

#### BACK-END

Open your 

Go to the backend directory, where docker-compose.yml is at.\

And then run the following command:

```
    docker-compose up
```

After that, you should see your docker service starting up.\

To stop service:
